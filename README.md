## Abstract


* Natural competence is one of the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer, an important process that contributes to host-use evolution and other types of environmental adaptation in bacteria. Recently, the plant pathogen *Xylella fastidiosa* has undergone expansion of its host and geographic ranges. Natural competence has been empirically documented for a few strains of *X. fastidiosa*, but its prevalence across genotypes and populations is largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the natural competence in vitro of 142 *X. fastidiosa* strains from diverse hosts and geographic origins, and recovered substantial variability among strains, particularly across subspecies. *X. fastidiosa* subsp. *fastidiosa* strains were largely naturally competent, while only 15% of studied subsp. *multiplex* strains showed recombination, and none of the strains classified in other subspecies were recombinant. While recombination rate varied across subspecies, climatic variables did not explain differences in rates across strains. A genome-wide association study identified several genes linked to variation in natural competence, including a heretofore unhypothesized role for *xadA2*, which codes for a surface afimbrial adhesin, and the already known fimbrial adhesin type IV pili genes *pilY1-1* and *pilY1-3*. Overall, this study highlights the variability of natural competence among *X. fastidiosa* strains and provides novel evidence for involvement of *xadA2* in homologous recombination.
